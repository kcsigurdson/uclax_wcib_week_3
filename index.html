    <h2>History of the Blueberry Pancake</h2>
    <p>
      Pancakes, in one form or another, have been around for thousands of years. The earliest forms were likely unleavened disks of wheat paste cooked directly on hot ashes, such as those eaten by Otzi the Iceman before his ill-fated stroll in the Alps 5,300 years ago. As culinary practices evolved, more ingredients were added to the mix, such as eggs, olive oil, curdled milk, cabbage, fruit, cheese, calcined potash and pretty much anything else you can fit in a griddle.Blueberries, however, took a long time to make their way into the dish. Native to North America, blueberries were first used by native peoples for medicine and food such as pemmican, a mixture of dried meat, fat, and berries. As Europeans moved into the region, they acquired a taste for this treat, in some cases trading it in 90 lb. bags.

      But the blueberry remained exclusively a wild food until 1912, when farmer Elizabeth White and botanist Frederick Coville developed a domesticated strain. It proved to be easy to grow as well as delicious, setting off a national craze for all things blueberry, including everything from alcohol to cosmetics to, yes, pancakes. In celebration of the arduous journey from antiquity to breakfast plate (and the much shorter journey from plate to stomach), January 28 is designated as National Blueberry Pancake Day. But if, for whatever reason, you aren’t feeling it today, there’s another prime opportunity coming up on Tuesday, Feb. 9. That’s Shrove Tuesday, a Catholic ecclesiastical holiday observed in Europe where people prepared for the Lenten fast by cooking up all of their thereafter-verboten eggs, dairy and fat in a delicious mess of hotcakes. Incidentally, in France Shrove Tuesday became Fat Tuesday, which we know today as Mardi Gras.

          <h2>Directions:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large mixing bowl.
            </li
            <li>
              In a separate large bowl, lightly whisk the eggs. Add the milk, sour cream, half the melted butter and the vanilla, whisking to blend.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg mixture into it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whisk the ingredients together just until blended. Fold the blueberries and lemon zest into the batter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with some of the remaining melted butter. For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot skillet
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook 3 or 4 pancakes at a time, depending on the size of the skillet. If the batter seems too thick, thin it with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.
            </li>
            <li>
              When bubbles begin to form and "pop" on the pancake's surface, after about 1 minute, and the outer edge looks done, flip it over and cook briefly for about 30 seconds on the other side.
            </li>
          </ol>
